# MHWpredict
*ML workflow to predict marine heatwaves.* 

This project involves tracking extreme and prolonged warming events in sea surface known as marine heatwaves that have been observed throughout the world. Their effects have led to increased economic tensions between nations due to the closures of lucrative fisheries and changes in catch quotas. Knowing when and where marine heatwaves will occur will mitigate the impacts of these events by informing response decisions that protect living marine resources.
